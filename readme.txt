Git is a version control system.
Git is a free software.
Changed something to test function of blabla.
Add a new line to test the dev branch.
This is a change in both master and new branch.
a new line to branch dev.
Now I am working on a new branch, while my boss tells me that there is a bug in the master branch that need to be fixed immediately, so I need to keep my curret work status and go back to fix the bug firstly, how can I do?
